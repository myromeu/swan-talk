Swan-Talk is an academic project initiated by the students at CATFOSS (batch 2009-2010).

It is a PyQt4 + python-twisted implementation of a LAN Chat.

The Project aims at being a beginner's guide to using python-twisted with PyQt4.
Please check the to-do list in the wiki to see the vision for swan-talk.

The project is inspired by Bart's PLC
