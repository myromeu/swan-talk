> In swan lan chat we use PyQt4? 4.4.2-4 is a toolkit for creating GUI applications. It is a blending of python programming language and the successfull Qt library. Qt library is one of the most powerful libraries on this planet. If not the most powerful.

> Creating an application in PyQT4 may be done in a few ways. The most common one is to use QTDesigner, which we get with QT. QTDesigner let us draw the GUI which is very handy for complicated interfaces. We can place widgets on the window, add names etc.

> To create an application in PyQT4 we have to:

  1. Create the GUI in QTDesigner

> 2. Set names in the Property Editor to ease coding of the application (QTDesigner)

> 3. Using pyuic4 create the python GUI class

> 4. Call the application using that GUI class

> 5. Extend it with our own slots

> 6. When you use a widget you go to pyqt4's classess and check methods of each used

> 7. widgets. The method names as "setText" are very easy to understand.
